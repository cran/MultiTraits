# MultiTraits 0.2.0 (2024-12-21)

## Bug fixes and minor improvements

* Fixed bug where discrete scales could not map aesthetics only consisting of
  `NA`s
* Fixed spurious warnings from `sec_axis()` with `breaks = NULL`.
* Patterns and gradients are now also enabled in `geom_sf()`.
* The default behaviour of `resolution()` has been reverted to pre-3.5.0 
  behaviour. Whether mapped discrete vectors should be treated as having 
  resolution of 1 is controlled by the new `discrete` argument.
* Fixed bug in `guide_bins()` and `guide_coloursteps()` where discrete breaks,
  such as the levels produced by `cut()`, were ordered incorrectly.
* Fixed calculation issues in CSR module
* Resolved NaN errors in TN module
* Optimized visualization effects across all modules (CSR, LHS, NPT, TN)
* Removed WH dataset
* Updated examples across package modules
