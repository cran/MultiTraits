#' Create a table of Leaf-Height-Seed (LHS) strategy types
#'
#' This function generates a data frame containing different plant growth strategies
#' based on the Leaf-Height-Seed (LHS) scheme. Each strategy is described by a
#' combination of traits and their corresponding ecological interpretation.
#'
#' @return A data frame with two columns:
#'   \describe{
#'     \item{type}{Character vector of LHS strategy combinations (e.g., "L-L-L", "L-L-S", etc.)}
#'     \item{strategy}{Character vector describing the ecological strategy for each type}
